                            <h1>Experiential Learning in Innovation, Technology, and Entrepreneurship (ELITE) Program for Black Youth</h1>
                            <p>The Experiential Learning in Innovation, Technology, and Entrepreneurship (ELITE) Program for Black Youth has been designed as a 
                                practical solution to enable Black Youth to develop hands-on skills that will be immediately transferable to disruptive 
                                technologies, including robotics, automation, advanced manufacturing, and tissue engineering.
                                </br></br>
                                This will be achieved by assembling teachers, engineers, scientists, and technologists at the University of Alberta, InnoTech 
                                Alberta, and industry partners to provide work-integrated training on real projects and relevant equipment. Candidate interns 
                                will be matched with hosts for full-time or part-time internships of up to 8 or 16 weeks. All interns will participate in leadership 
                                and entrepreneur training. The interns will receive counselling and coaching for resiliency and managing the demands of professional 
                                careers.</p>

                            <p>This retreat is for you if you are a climate or social justice activist or grassroots organiser who is working with questions like:
                            </p>
                                <br/>

                                        <li>What does it feel like to be in a truly collaborative and welcoming space?</li>
                                        <li>How do we counter cancel culture and other unhealthy ways we sometimes treat each other?</li>

                            <p>
                                The retreat will be held between January 21 and 26, 2025 on Nex̱wlélex̱wm (Bowen Island). The aim of the gathering is to bring 
                                together between 15 to 20 climate, racial and social justice movement leaders from Greater Vancouver and southwest BC to experience 
                                the power of being in a community of belonging.<br/><br/>
                                Movements of Belonging will be facilitated by five experienced trainers and activists, Kazu Haga, Leonie Smith, HyoYoung Minna, 
                                Jeff Carolin, and catherine strickland. Each person brings a unique and varied set of skills, experiences and perspectives centred 
                                around building communities of belonging for nonviolent social change. This facilitation team, along with all participants, will 
                                co-create the gathering. Through experiential learning, ritual, play, creative expression and practices that build connection, we 
                                will raise our collective capacity for creating movements that offer belonging and meaning as we work towards a more just and healthy
                                world.

                                create communities of belonging. The skills and practices offered are grounded in principles of nonviolence,

                            <p>This event is a continuation of the important conversation we began at our last Forum on March 24, 2023, focusing on the 
                                barriers faced by racialized newcomer youth in sports participation. The Collective Action Forum is organized by AHC, a 
                                dynamic, community-based agency that provides settlement and capacity-building services to people of all ages and backgrounds. 
                                AHC works tirelessly to support underserved and marginalized communities in Edmonton and across Alberta, fostering an 
                                inclusive society by addressing the barriers equity-deserving groups face in fully participating in society.
